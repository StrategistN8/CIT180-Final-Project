To do this, they employ tanks of construction nanites which break down and reassemble raw materials into the required shapes.","Ohm robots are the light infantry of Novus. They are often used in vast swarms and are capable of using their power cores as makeshift explosives against larger opponents.",
              "Hackers specialize in machine warfare, being able to overwrite defensive turrents and disable the motive systems of enemy vehicles. They can also use Novus Viruses as a catalyst to do massive system damage on infected machines.","Blade Troopers are advanced robotic infantry designed specifically to counter the heavy troops of the Hierarchy. They are equipped with a multitude of advanced technologies to allow them to perform their role, ranging from visual scramblers to nanoite replicators which allow them to create short-lived clones equally capable of slicing up opponents as their parent unit.",

They excell at ambush applications but can also be used in direct conflicts as well using their speed to avoid retaliation.",  "Antimatter tanks provide the bulk of Novus' armored companies. The anti-matter pellets they use as munitions stick to targets and explode shortly after, causing a chain reaction with any other pellets likewise attached. The tank can also vent its core at will, pelting the area with smaller pellets to diswade infantry attacks.", 
              "Amplifers are sonic artillery, wielding a dangerous beam of concentrated sound calibrated to shatter structures and Hierarchy hardpoints. They can also release a sonic pulse if attacked in close quarters.","Field Inverters are heavy walking robots that can manipulate electromagnetic fields to either hurl nanite-based projectiles at vehicle targets or project an energy shield capable of protecting nearby units.",

                    <p>The original creators of what would become Novus were all but wiped out during a Hierarchy invasion, leaving behind a handful of sapient machines to rebuild. Since then Novus has been 
                        a constant thorn in the side of the Hierarchy, leading to the events of <em>Universe at War: Earth Assault</em> where they find things strangly amiss... Novus is lead by the Founder (the original surviving intelligence), Vertigo, and Mirable who stands out as the lone organic among an army of machines.
