                        <p>In the year 2012, earth falls under attack at the hands of the alien Hierarchy.  The game opens in Washington DC where a small band of soldiers have been tasked with a mission to rescue the President from the besieged capital.  Lead by Colonial Randal Moore, the team is forced to fight their way through small pockets of alien infantry to reach their objective at the capital building. 
                        Throughout the advance reports come in regarding the state of other world powers and increasingly severe alien resistance in the form of aerial saucers and tripodal drones.  As the losses mount, mechanized reinforcements arrive to blast through the enemy machines and complete the push for the capital building.
                        As the president is evacuated, a large object drops from the sky and crashes into the capital building.  As the smoke clears, an ominous mechanical groan reverberates across the capital as an enormous walker emerges from the wreckage and begins firing upon the defenders.  
                        </p>
                        <hr/>
                        <p>The surviors are forced to withdraw to a nearby military base in hopes of fortifying against the looming mechanical monstrosity. The armored division is tasked with distracting the walker while the infantry escort the president to the relative safety of the base. For their efforts, Moore is given a battlefield promotion to general and told to mobilize everything they have before the walker finishes harassing the mechanized company and turns its attention to their base. 
                        After getting the facilities functional and amassing what units were available, the remnants of the mechanized division roll in with the walker in pursuit.  The collossus flattens structures in its path and resists all attempts to pierce its armor, eventually smashing a path directly inside the military base.   As the forces prepare to make a final stand, a series of portals open and robotic forces emerge to do battle with the attacker.  Moore gives an order to withdraw as the enemy walker begins retreating away from the new arrivals.
